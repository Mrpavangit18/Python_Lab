# Task 1: Suppose you have a dataset containing daily temperature readings for a city, and you want to identify days with extreme temperature conditions.
#         Find days where the temperature either exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (hot day) or dropped below 5 degrees Celsius (cold day). 
#         Input: temperatures = np.array([32.5, 34.2, 36.8, 29.3, 31.0, 38.7, 23.1, 18.5, 22.8, 37.2])
import numpy as np

# Given temperature data
temperatures = np.array([32.5, 34.2, 36.8, 29.3, 31.0, 38.7, 23.1, 18.5, 22.8, 37.2])

# Find hot days (temperature > 35째C)
hot_days_indices = np.where(temperatures > 35)[0]
hot_days_temperatures = temperatures[hot_days_indices]

# Find cold days (temperature < 5째C)
cold_days_indices = np.where(temperatures < 5)[0]
cold_days_temperatures = temperatures[cold_days_indices]

# Print the results
print("Hot Days:")
print("Day   Temperature (C)")
